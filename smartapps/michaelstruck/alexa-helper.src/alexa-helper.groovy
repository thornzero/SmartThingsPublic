		"Perfect for use with the Amazon Echo ('Alexa').\n\nTo use, first create the required momentary button tiles or virtual switches/dimmers from the SmartThings IDE. "+
		"You may also use any physical switches already associated with SmartThings. Include these switches within the Echo/SmartThings app, then discover the switches on the Echo. "+
		"For control over SmartThings aspects such as modes and routines, add a new scenario choosing Modes/Routines/Switches/HTTP/SHM scenario type. "+
		"Within scenario settings, choose the Alexa discovered switch to be monitored and tie the on/off state of that switch to a specific routine, mode, URL, Smart Home Monitor "+
		"security state or the on/off state of other switches. The chosen functions or switches will fire when the main switch changes, except in cases where you have a delay specified. "+ 
		"This time delay is optional. "+
		"\n\nPlease note that if you are using a momentary switch you should only define either an 'on' action or an 'off' action within each scenario, but not both.\n\n" +
		"To control a thermostat, add a new scenario choosing the 'thermostat' scenario type, then under the settings choose a dimmer switch (usually a virtual dimmer) and the thermostat you wish to control. "+
		"You can also control the on/off of the thermostat with the state of the dimmer switch, limit the range the thermostat will reach (for example, even if you accidently set the dimmer to 100, the value sent to the "+
		"thermostat could be limited to 72) or set the initial value of the thermostat when you change modes or turn the dimmer on. Momentary switches can be used to activate the thermostat from heating, cooling, or auto modes."+
		"\n\nTo control a connected speaker, add a new scenario choosing the 'speaker' scenario type, then under the settings choose a dimmer switch (usually a virtual dimmer) and speaker you wish to control. "+
		"You can set the initial volume upon turning on the speaker, along with volume limits. Finally, you can utilize other virtual switches to choose next/previous tracks."
